# `/FRENCH`

Welcome to the (FRENCH) translated book !

Here is the core of the translation work of this repository.

Basically, it's a (progressive) copy of the main content of the root `/`, but
translated.

This root remains as-it-is, stay in English, and will be updated further when
there are some updates on the English book.

The translated pages are in [`/FRENCH/src/`][] folder.

Please read [`/FRENCH/CONTRIBUTING.md`][].
